# Loan Approval Prediction Web App 🚀

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a **Loan Approval Prediction Web Application** built using **Streamlit**. It leverages a **Machine Learning Model (e.g., XGBoost)** trained on financial data to predict **whether a loan application will be approved or rejected** based on user inputs. The application is interactive, featuring sliders for data input, visual confidence levels, and financial insights through visualizations.

---

## 🔍 Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for seamless user interaction.
- **Interactive Inputs:** Sliders for setting **income, loan amount, credit score**, and more.
- **Instant Predictions:** Real-time loan approval prediction powered by a **pre-trained machine learning model (XGBoost/Logistic Regression)**.
- **Confidence Display:** Shows **approval confidence score** alongside the result.
- **Visual Insights:** Plots displaying:
  - **Loan Amount vs. Annual Income**.
  - **Credit Score Distribution**.
  - **Loan Percent Income Ratio Gauge**.
- **Derived Feature:** Loan-to-Income ratio for better prediction performance.

## 📈 Sample Visualization
- Loan Amount vs Income Bar Chart
- Credit Score Distribution Plot
- Loan Percent Income Ratio Feedback

## 🧑‍💻 Model Training (Optional)
The `model.pkl` file is a pre-trained **XGBoost/Logistic Regression model**. If you wish to **train your own model**:
- Collect the dataset.
- Preprocess the data (scaling, encoding, feature engineering).
- Train using XGBoost, Logistic Regression, or any preferred model.
- Save the trained model:
  ```python
  import pickle
  with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
      pickle.dump(trained_model, file)
  ```
